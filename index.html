<h1>About me</h1>

<p>I am a half-Welsh, half-Argentinian electrical engineer who studied in Uruguay and France.</p>

<p>I have recently completed the Masters in "Acoustics, Signal Processing, and Computer Science applied to Music" (ATIAM in French) at IRCAM/Sorbonne University (Paris). This was supported by a scholarship from ANII, Uruguay's national agency for research and innovation, and included a 6-month internship at Deezer Research.</p>

<p>My expertise is in signal processing, machine learning and music information retrieval. I'm also very interested in research openness, tech accessibility and ethics in the design and use of machine learning models.</p>

<p>I'm an amateur violinist who loves tango, murga, and folk music.</p>

<p>Please, go ahead and listen to some Uruguayan murga:</p>
